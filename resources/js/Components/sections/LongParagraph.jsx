        He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with
        his intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he
        was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily
        deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that
        it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence

        He wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends. It would be
        a risky move. Yes, the truth would make things a lot easier if they all
        stayed on the same page, but the truth might fracture the group leaving
        everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth. It
        was time to decide which way to go.

        The tree missed the days the kids used to come by and play. It still
        wore the tire swing the kids had put up in its branches years ago
        although both the tire and the rope had seen better days. The tree had
        watched all the kids in the neighborhood grow up and leave, and it
        wondered if there would ever be a time when another child played and
        laughed again under its branches. That was the hope that the tree wished
        every day as the swing gently swung empty in the wind.

        He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the
        beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was
        supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have
        been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he
        wasn't.

        He read about a hike called the incline in the guidebook. It said it was
        a strenuous hike and to bring plenty of water. “A beautiful hike to the
        clouds” described one review. “Not for the faint-hearted,” said another.
        “Not too bad of a workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I’d hike
        it when I fly in from Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen's
        wellness conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I
        could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for a
        70-year-old low-lander.

        There were only two ways to get out of this mess if they all worked
        together. The problem was that neither was all that appealing. One would
        likely cause everyone a huge amount of physical pain while the other
        would likely end up with everyone in jail. In Sam's mind, there was only
        one thing to do. He threw everyone else under the bus and he secretly
        sprinted away leaving the others to take the fall without him.

        There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them
        during her life, but this one was different. She found herself holding
        onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at
        your insides if you didn't tell someone about it, but it could end up
        getting you killed if you did.

        Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the past weeks. When
        you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that’s about
        all you can do anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted
        shut. She couldn’t reach it if she wanted too, with that hole in the
        floor. She thought she could escape through it but three stories is a
        bit far down.

        There are only three ways to make this work. The first is to let me take
        care of everything. The second is for you to take care of everything.
        The third is to split everything 50 / 50. I think the last option is the
        most preferable, but I'm certain it'll also mean the end of our
        marriage.

        He scolded himself for being so tentative. He knew he shouldn't be so
        cautious, but there was a sixth sense telling him that things weren't
        exactly as they appeared. It was that weird chill that rolls up your
        neck and makes the hair stand on end. He knew that being so tentative
        could end up costing him the job, but he learned that listening to his
        sixth sense usually kept him from getting into a lot of trouble.

        It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death
        had actually given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and
        upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less
        than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do
        with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.

        Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it
        inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the
        field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was
        nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years
        of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving
        even an ounce of interest in the topic.

        Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the
        past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by. He felt at peace in
        the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon
        come to an end. He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he
        smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember.

        Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but
        it still came as a shock. The warning signs had been ignored in favor of
        the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That
        possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be
        destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing
        down.

        Samantha wanted to be famous. The problem was that she had never
        considered all the downsides to actually being famous. Had she taken the
        time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never
        agreed to publically sing that first song.
